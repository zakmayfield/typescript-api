# Express | TypeScript | Prisma | Postgres

A sandbox API for me to practice server side development.

**Built with**:

- Express
  - I chose express because it's lightweight and unopinionated
  - Forces me to modularize my code, and learn more efficient architecture patterns.
- TypeScript
  - For obvious reasons.
- Prisma
  - I didn't want to write SQL, and wanted more productivity so choosing Prisma felt right.
- Postgres
  - I have a preference to working with relational databases, so I chose Postgres for my database.
